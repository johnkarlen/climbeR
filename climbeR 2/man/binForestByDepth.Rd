\title{Bin Forest by Depth}
\usage{
binForestByDepth(ranger_obj)
}
\arguments{
\item{ranger_obj}{A ranger object from the ranger package, which was created
with param write.forest set to TRUE. In other words, it must have a 
'forest' property.}
}
\value{
A list with 2 elements. The first is a list of vectors - 
one for each independent variable ocurring in the forest (this may not 
be the complete set of independent variables, but we will account for any
variables that do not occur in the forest later). Each vector contains all
minimal depths of maximal subtrees in the forest, for the corresponding 
independent variable. The second element is a vector of tree 
heights 'forest_depths'.
}
\description{
Given a forest object from the ranger package, this function will bin the
forest into depths. This is a helper function for the 'calculateAMDMS'
function.
