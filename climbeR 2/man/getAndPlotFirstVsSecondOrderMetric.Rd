\title{Calculate the metric, and make Second Order vs First Order plot}
\usage{
getAndPlotFirstVsSecondOrderMetric(ranger_result, plot_missing_so = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{ranger_result}{A ranger object from the ranger package, which was created
setting param write.forest to TRUE. In other words, it must have a 
'forest' property.}

\item{plot_missing_so}{An optional parameter to show features that only
have a first order metric value. Variables can have high feature strength, 
but may be unlikely to have a second maximal subtree because of low
cardinality.}
}
\value{
a list; element 1 is a data.frame containing subtree depth
data, element 2 is the plot.
}
\description{
Comprehensive function for calculating minimal depth of a maximal 
subtree averaged over the forest and then plotting the result.
}
\examples{
require(survival)
library(ranger)
rg.veteran <- ranger(Surv(time, status) ~ ., data = veteran, write.forest =
TRUE)
result <- getAndPlotFirstVsSecondOrderMetric(rg.veteran)
}
