\alias{plotFirstAndSecondOrderMetric}
\title{Plot Second Order vs First Order, minimal depth of a maximal subtree,
averaged over the forest (shortened to "metric" for brevity)}
\usage{
plotFirstAndSecondOrderMetric(eval_data, plot_missing_so = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{eval_data}{The output of calculateAMDMS.}

\item{plot_missing_so}{An optional parameter to show features that only
have a first order metric value. Variables can have high feature strength, 
but may be unlikely to have a second maximal subtree because of low
cardinality.}
}
\value{
so_vs_fo A ggplot2 object, which shows second order vs first
order average minimal depth of a maximal subtree depth.
}
\description{
Given eval data from calculateAMDMS, plot the result.
}
